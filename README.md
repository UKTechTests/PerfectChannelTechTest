I gave myself 4 hours to get as much done as I could.
Because of my visual impairment I am slower than other developers as it takes me longer to flip between the spec and the code.

I have not fully completed the solution, nor had time to fully test it.
From the brief testing I have done my implimentation is not correct and has bugs.

I have left out lawn perimeter awareness.
Input validation.  Not all the code is covered by unit tests.
It took me a little while to get my head around the possible solution before I began coding which took up some time.

Given more time I would have:
1.	Implemented rules for governing lawnmower movement, lawnmower positioning.
2.	I would have added more unit test coverage.
In some cases I have passed a string into an int without proper checks to see if this is indeed possible.  This can cause the application to crash.
3.	 Added in error handling and display of appropriate messages with opportunity for user to correct input where needed.
4.	Removal of switch statements and implementation of dictionary strategies.  This is more maintainable and less verbose.
5.	Included integration tests to ensure correctness of solution
